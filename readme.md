# Homework Assignment 1
This API comprises of 2 files. I have considered the course as a guide.
I have removed some parts of the code as designed in the course (like trimming down the data object passed to handlers).
 
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to /app directory
3. Run 
```
node index.js
```
4. To get a JSON response, use Postman, or any other similar application, to send a post request to following URL*
```
localhost:3000/helloWorld
```

*The url has a port number which depends on the environment you use to run the app. Check the config.js for more clarity.
